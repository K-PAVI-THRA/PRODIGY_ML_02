# PRODIGY_ML_02

I have implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm as part of Task-02: "Create a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history." K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. The goal is to partition the dataset into distinct clusters, where the data points within each cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

# **Dataset**

Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

# Knowledge Gained

In this task, I learned how to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchase history. I gained valuable insights into selecting the right features for clustering, determining the optimal number of clusters, and visualizing the results to better understand customer segments. This task also deepened my knowledge of unsupervised learning techniques in machine learning.

1. **Understanding K-Means Clustering**: I learned how the K-Means algorithm works by iteratively assigning data points to clusters based on their similarity and updating centroids to minimize within-cluster variance. This helped me better understand unsupervised learning, particularly how K-Means identifies patterns without labeled data.

2. **Feature Selection and Preprocessing**: I gained insights into selecting relevant features, such as annual income and spending score, which significantly influence clustering outcomes. This task also reinforced the importance of data preprocessing, including scaling and normalization, to ensure effective clustering.

3. **Optimal Cluster Determination**: I explored techniques like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). This concept was crucial for balancing model complexity and accuracy, ensuring that customer segments were meaningful and actionable.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**: I learned how to visualize clustering results using scatter plots, which helped me interpret the distinct customer groups formed by K-Means. This visual analysis provided a clearer understanding of customer segmentation in the retail context.

5. **Practical Implementation with Python**: This task strengthened my practical skills in implementing K-Means using Pythonâ€™s 'scikit-learn' library. I also improved my ability to evaluate clustering performance and visualize data, leading to a deeper understanding of customer behavior analysis.
